1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a JavaScript library that allows us to write components and build complex user interfaces. It also helps us deal with changes on the DOM as state; when state is changed, so are the elements that use them.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

How can I make my page REACT to changes?

1. Describe state.

State is a property that can be updated, and will automatically render that update everywhere the state is used.

1. Describe props.

props are properties passed into components allowing us to access their state when needed.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are changes that happen in a function scope that affect variables outside of its scope. We can sync effects to state changed by using useEffect and passing the state as its second parameter.
